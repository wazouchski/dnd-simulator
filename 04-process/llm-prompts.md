# LLM Prompts Library

> **Project:** D&D Character Balance Tester  
> **Purpose:** Copy-paste prompts optimized for AI-assisted development  
> **Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

This document contains tested prompts for common development tasks. Each prompt is designed to maximize AI output quality by providing the right structure and context.

**Placeholder Syntax:**
- `{{file.md}}` → Insert content from that file
- `{{DESCRIPTION}}` → Insert your own content for that field
- For AI tools with file access (Cursor, Claude Desktop), reference files directly: `@docs/00-context/vision.md`

## Starting a Session

### Prompt: Initialize New Session

Use at the start of each development session to establish context.

```markdown
I'm working on a project called {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

## Project Vision
{{vision.md}}

## What's Currently Built
{{system-state.md}}

## Today's Focus
I want to work on {{FEATURE_OR_COMPONENT_NAME}}.

Here's the task I'm tackling:
{{dev-tasks.md → specific task}}

Let me know when you're ready, and I'll share any additional context needed.
```

---

### Prompt: Continue Previous Work

Use when resuming work from a previous session.

```markdown
I'm continuing work on {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

## Quick Context
{{vision.md → 2-3 sentence summary}}

## Last Session Summary
{{implementation-log.md → most recent entry}}

## What Was Built
{{RELEVANT_CODE_OR_STATE}}

## Today's Task
{{dev-tasks.md → next task}}

Let's pick up from where we left off.
```

## Document Generation

### Prompt: Generate vision.md

Use when starting a new project.

```markdown
Help me create a vision document for a new project.

Please generate a vision.md document with the following sections:
1. Purpose - What this product does and why it matters
2. Target Users - Who uses this and their key characteristics
3. Boundaries - What we explicitly are NOT building
4. Core Principles - 3-4 guiding principles for decisions
5. North Star Metrics - How we measure success
6. Success Definition for v1.0 - What does "done" look like for MVP

Use markdown formatting with tables where appropriate.
```

2. **User Stories** - For each major feature:
   - Story format: "As a [user], I want [action] so that [benefit]"
   - Acceptance criteria as checklist items
   - Priority (P0 = must have, P1 = should have, P2 = nice to have)

3. **Default Settings/Data** - Any seed data or defaults

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Performance targets
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Browser support
   - Security considerations

5. **Out of Scope** - Features explicitly not in v1.0

6. **Release Plan** - Rough sprint breakdown

Format with markdown tables for requirements and checklists for acceptance criteria.
```

### Prompt: Generate Dev Tasks

Use to break down technical design into executable work.

```markdown
Break down this technical design into atomic development tasks:

## Technical Design
{{tech-design.md}}

## Context
Each task should be:
- Completable in 30-60 minutes
- Specific enough for an AI assistant to implement
- Include clear acceptance criteria
- Reference the relevant design section

Please generate a dev-tasks.md with:

For each task:
1. **Task ID** (TASK-001, etc.)
2. **Title** (clear, action-oriented)
3. **Status** (Not Started/In Progress/Complete)
4. **Priority** (P0/P1/P2)
5. **Estimated Time**
6. **Dependencies** (other task IDs if any)
7. **Context Files** - Which docs to share with AI
8. **Task Description** - Detailed implementation instructions
9. **Acceptance Criteria** - Checkboxes

Group tasks logically (Foundation, Integration, Polish).
Include a progress tracker table at the end.
```

## Behavior
{{KEY_INTERACTIONS_AND_STATES}}

## Styling Approach
{{CSS_MODULES_OR_OTHER}}

## Existing Patterns
{{SIMILAR_COMPONENT_CODE_IF_EXISTS}}

Please provide:
1. Component file ({{COMPONENT_NAME}}.jsx)
2. Styles file ({{COMPONENT_NAME}}.module.css)
3. Index file (index.js)

Follow these conventions:
- Functional components with hooks

## Tips for Better AI Interactions

### DO ✅

- **Provide complete context** - More is better than less
- **Be specific** - "Add error handling for network failures" not "make it better"
- **Include examples** - Of existing code patterns to follow
- **Reference documents** - "See tech-design.md section X"
- **Ask for explanations** - "Explain why this approach over alternatives"
- **Iterate** - "That's close, but change X to Y"

### DON'T ❌

- **Ask for entire apps** - Too large, quality drops
- **Accept blindly** - Always review and test
- **Skip context** - Every session needs grounding
- **Be vague** - "Fix the bug" without details
- **Forget to log** - Document what AI helped create
